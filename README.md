Introduction to SQL in DBMS
  Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful and standardized language used to interact with relational database management systems (DBMS). 
It serves as a bridge between users or applications and the underlying database, allowing for the creation, manipulation, and retrieval of data.
In this introduction, we'll explore the key concepts and capabilities of SQL within the context of a database management system.

Key Concepts of SQL
1. Data Definition Language (DDL):
SQL includes commands for defining and managing the structure of the database, such as creating tables, defining relationships between tables,
and setting constraints on data.

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database. Common DML commands include INSERT (to add new records),
UPDATE (to modify existing records), and DELETE (to remove records).

3. Data Query Language (DQL):
DQL is used to retrieve specific data from the database. The most common DQL command is SELECT, which allows you to
specify which columns and rows of data you want to retrieve.

4. Data Control Language (DCL):
DCL commands manage access permissions and security for the database. They include commands like GRANT (to give specific permissions to users or roles)
and REVOKE (to remove permissions).

SQL Statements
SQL statements are used to communicate with a database. Here are some fundamental SQL statements:

1. CREATE TABLE:
Defines a new table's structure, including column names, data types, and constraints.

2. INSERT INTO:
Adds new records into a table.

3. SELECT:
Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.

4. UPDATE:
Modifies existing records in a table.

5. DELETE FROM:
Removes records from a table based on specified conditions.

6. ALTER TABLE:
Modifies an existing table's structure, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns.

7. JOIN:
Combines data from multiple tables based on related columns.

8. GROUP BY:
Groups data for aggregate functions, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.

9. ORDER BY:
Sorts query results in ascending or descending order based on specified columns.

SQL and Relational Databases
SQL is closely associated with relational databases, which store data in structured tables with defined relationships between them. 
Relational databases use SQL to manage data and ensure its integrity and consistency. Some popular relational database management systems that 
support SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

Conclusion
SQL is a fundamental component of modern database management systems, providing a standardized and efficient way to interact with and manage data. 
Whether you're querying data, modifying records, or designing a database schema, SQL empowers developers and database administrators to work effectively 
with structured data. By mastering SQL, you gain the ability to create, manipulate, and retrieve information from databases, enabling you to build robust 
and data-driven applications.
